# Smart Labelling Tool and Attention U-Net Suite

## Overview
This repository provides two major components working together:

1. **Deep Learning Suite** – TensorFlow-based training and inference utilities centred on an Attention U-Net model for high-resolution medical image segmentation.
2. **Smart Labelling System** – a PyQt5 application that streamlines manual annotation using predictions and uncertainty estimates generated by the models.

**Note:** This project is a prototype and remains under active development. APIs and behaviour may change between versions.

The typical workflow involves training a segmentation model, running inference to obtain probability maps and uncertainties, and then using the graphical interface to rapidly label clusters of points. The exported annotations can be fed back into the training scripts for iterative improvement.

## Features
### Attention U-Net
- Decoder includes optional attention gates and group normalisation for stable training.
- Mixed precision and distributed training via `MirroredStrategy`.
- YAML configuration for architecture and data parameters.

### Smart Labelling System
- Opens HDF5 or SQLite databases produced by the inference tools.
- Clusters candidate points and presents them in an interactive grid for fast labelling.
- Propagates uncertainty scores as labels are applied so that recommendations update in real time.
- Autosave, project management and preview dialogues to inspect full-size images with overlayed annotations.
- Export of labelled points to JSON for further model training or analysis.

## Getting Started
### Environment
Install the dependencies with Conda:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate the environment with `conda activate SLT`.

### Training a Model
Edit `configurations/configuration.yaml` to match your dataset. Start training with:
```bash
python DeepLearning/training/main.py --config configurations/configuration.yaml
```
Checkpoints and logs will be written to the directory specified in the configuration file.

### Running Inference
The scripts under `DeepLearning/inference/` generate prediction logits and uncertainty measures that the GUI can read. See `main_infer.py` for a minimal example.

### Launching the Smart Labelling Tool
Run the GUI from the repository root:
```bash
python gui_main.py
```
A start-up dialogue allows you to continue a previous session, load an existing project, or create a new one from a predictions database. Label clusters of points and export the results when finished.

## Repository Layout
```
DeepLearning/    – model architectures, training and inference code
GUI/             – PyQt5 smart labelling application
```

## Tests
Unit tests for both components can be executed with:
```bash
pytest
```

## Contributing
Follow PEP8 with four spaces per indent and target Python 3.8. Public modules, classes and functions should include docstrings. New GUI features require tests under `GUI/unittests`.
